httpd-log-anon-filter
=====================

about
-----

This is a fork of the http-log-anon-filter.pl from Christian Garbs <mitch@cgarbs.de>. I liked the script from
him, but i doesnt fit all my needs, so i forked his script. The fork just randomize the last octet of the IPv4
Adress and not the complete Adress. The Goal was that one can anonymize the IP of the Webserver visitors BUT give scripts like Awstats more accuracy about the GeoLocation from the Visitor.

the original project page can be visited here: https://github.com/mmitch/httpd-log-anon-filter

httpd-log-anon-filter is an anonymizing log filter for httpd logs.

It is used to change the IP address/hostname field of webserver logs
to something else than the original IP address/hostname in order to
comply with German data privacy laws.

- Perl


usage
-----

    usage:
        httpd-log-anon-filter.pl <output_logfile>

httpd-log-anon-filter reads data in common or combined log format (in
fact any data that has the IP address or hostname in the first
whitespace delimited field on a line) from STDIN and appends the
processed output to a filename given as the first and only commandline
argument.  Giving no output filename results in an error.

For every log line received, the IP address/hostname is hashed using
MD5 and a new IP address (IPv6 for IPv6 input data, IPv4 for
everything else) is generated.  The new address replaces the old
address/hostname and the new log line is written to the given
filename.

On every startup, httpd-log-anon-filter generates a salt, so multiple
invocations won't generate the same output for the same input.  As
long as httpd-log-anon-filter is not restarted, any given input
address is always mapped to the same output address, so it is still
possible to read logs in realtime and look for errors or follow some
patterns.

On common system configurations (eg. Debian's default Apache
installation), logs are rotated daily and thus the webserver is
reloaded, which will also restart httpd-log-anon-filter and give you
a new salt every day.

Beware that multiple instances of httpd-log-anon-filter will work with
different salts, eg. when you have a non-SSL configuration and an SSL
configuration both logging to the same file, they will possibly spawn
two instances of httpd-log-anon-filter and the same source address
will be mapped differently in the logs, depending on whether a http
or https request was issued.


### usage with Apache ###

Apache 2.4 supports
[piped logs](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html#piped).
To use httpd-log-anon-filter, add a ``CustomLog`` statement like this:

```
CustomLog "|/path/to/httpd-log-anon-filter.pl /var/log/access_log" combined
```

This will write an anonymized log to the default log location
``/var/log/access_log``.  Apache automatically starts and stops
httpd-log-anon-filter as needed, log rotation and maintenance should
simply work as before.


customization
-------------

Currently, httpd-log-anon-filter can't really be customized.  You can
comment/uncomment some parts of the code:

 * IPv6 addresses are by default randomized completely.  Most hashes
   will propably be non-existing addresses, but others will be real
   and your log will simply contain wrong information (well, that's
   the point in the first place).  If for any reason you want to 'play
   nice', you can uncomment one of two other lines instead to either
   only generate addresses from ``2001:db8::/32`` (address range
   reserved for documentation purposes) or from ``0100::/64`` (discard).

 * IPv4 addresses are also completely randomized.  Here the
   alternative is to use addresses from ``10.0.0.0/8`` (private
   address range), but that leaves you with only 24 random bits.
